## Project Status & Roadmap

**Completion: ~10%**

### What Exists
- ✅ Comprehensive planning documentation (16+ markdown files)
- ✅ Channel configuration file (9 channels defined)
- ✅ Directory structure for content organization
- ✅ Hardware integration plans (cable box, LED display, keypad)
- ✅ Development roadmap with phases
- ✅ Requirements.txt with dependencies

### Known Limitations & Missing Features

**Code Implementation:**
- ❌ **NO Working Code** - Only 1 Python file (main.py) which imports non-existent modules
- ❌ **Core Modules Missing** - `core.tv_controller`, channels, UI modules don't exist
- ❌ **No Video Playback** - No actual video player implementation
- ❌ **No Channel Switching** - Logic not implemented
- ❌ **No IR Remote Support** - Hardware integration code doesn't exist

**Content:**
- ❌ **No Media Files** - Empty media directories, no actual video content
- ❌ **No Commercials** - Shared commercials directory is empty
- ❌ **Content Acquisition** - Need 20+ hours per channel (0 hours currently)

**Hardware:**
- ❌ **Hardware Not Built** - Cable box design documented but not assembled
- ❌ **No Physical Components** - No Raspberry Pi setup, no CRT integration
- ❌ **No Testing** - Can't test without hardware

**Integration:**
- ⚠️ **FieldStation42 Dependency** - Roadmap shows pivot to using existing platform instead of custom code
- ❌ **Weather Channel** - Weather Star 4000+ integration not implemented
- ❌ **Gaming Channel** - EmulationStation integration not implemented

### Project Approach Shift

The development roadmap shows a **strategic pivot** from building custom Python code to leveraging the existing **FieldStation42** platform:
- Reduces development time from 12 weeks to 6-8 weeks
- Cuts hardware costs by 55%
- Provides proven channel switching and scheduling
- Uses Shane Mason's cable box design

### What Needs Work

1. **Decision Point** - Finalize whether to use FieldStation42 or build custom Python solution
2. **Hardware Procurement** - Order Raspberry Pi 5, cable box components, CRT adapter
3. **Content Collection** - Acquire 20+ hours of video per channel
4. **FieldStation42 Setup** - Install and configure if going that route
5. **Custom Code** - Implement all core modules if building from scratch
6. **Hardware Assembly** - 3D print cable box, wire LED display and keypad
7. **CRT Integration** - Test HDMI to composite adapter and video output
8. **Testing** - End-to-end testing with actual hardware

### Current Status

This is a **comprehensive planning project** with excellent documentation but minimal implementation. The project represents ~10% completion with:
- Strong vision and detailed planning
- Complete channel lineup and configuration
- Decision point between custom build vs. FieldStation42 platform
- **Zero working code or content currently**

**Reality Check**: This is a specification/design document, not a working project. All 6 roadmap phases are unchecked. Main.py cannot run because required modules don't exist.

### Next Steps to Make This Real

**If Using FieldStation42 (Recommended):**
1. Install and test FieldStation42 platform
2. Order hardware components (~$150 vs original $330)
3. Begin content acquisition (most time-consuming task)
4. 3D print cable box components
5. Follow Phase 1-6 roadmap in DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md

**If Building Custom Python Solution:**
1. Implement core.tv_controller module
2. Build channel management system
3. Create video playback engine with pygame/VLC
4. Implement IR remote support
5. Build scheduling system
6. **Estimated**: 200+ hours of development work

### Contributing

This is a personal hobby project. The planning phase is well-documented in the `docs/` directory, particularly:
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` - Implementation phases
- `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Vision and goals
- `docs/hardware/` - Hardware integration details

**Note**: Ambitious retro TV project with thorough planning. Needs significant development and content work to become functional.
